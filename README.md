# AI-Child-Protection
Traditional parental controls rely on manual settings, making them easy to bypass. This AI-driven system ensures real-time monitoring and adaptive content control using face detection and AI-based age estimation for smarter child protection.
 AI-Powered Child Protection System for Smartphones
 📌 Project Overview
This project introduces an AI-based face detection system designed to protect children from accessing inappropriate content on smartphones. Unlike traditional parental controls that rely on manual settings, this system **automatically detects when a child is using the device** and dynamically enforces restrictions.

🚀 Key Features
- ✅ Real-Time Face Detection & Age Estimation– Uses AI to recognize the user and determine if they are a child.
- ✅ Automatic Content Filtering – Blocks adult websites, explicit apps, and unsafe content in real time.
- ✅ Instant Mode Switching– When an adult is detected, restrictions are lifted without needing a password.
- ✅ Secure & Hard to Bypass – Works even if the child resets the phone or switches accounts.
- ✅ Parental Alerts & Monitoring – Sends notifications if a child attempts to access restricted content.

🛠️ How It Works
1. The system uses the front camera to detect a face.
2. AI-based age estimation determines if the user is a child or an adult.
3. If a child is detected, the system automatically enables Safe Model, restricting harmful content.
4. When an adult is detected, normal access is restored without manual intervention.
5. If a child tries to bypass the system, parents receive an immediate alert.

🔧 Technology Stack
- Face Detection & Age Estimation – OpenCV, TensorFlow, Deep Learning Models
- Content Filtering– Web Filtering APIs, Safe Browsing Techniques
- Mobile App Integration – Android/iOS, AI-based Device Management

🔥 Future Enhancements
- ⭐ Emotion Detection – Identify if the child is distressed while using the device.
- ⭐ Personalized Restrictions – Adjust content filters based on the child's behavior and usage patterns.
- ⭐ Multi-User Profiles – Support for multiple users with different access levels.
